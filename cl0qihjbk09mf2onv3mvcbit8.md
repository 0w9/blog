## Why is ENS not a domain service?

Hello everyone! This blog post will cover the technical aspects of ENS and other ethereum domain registration services such as UnitedDomains. Here is a short overview about the topics I will talk about in this post:

1. How did domains get started?
2. How do domains work/ registrants?
3. What is a ENS, and how does it work?
4. Why you cant handle a ENS like a domain.
5. Why does everyone use ENS as domain?

In the beginning we will dive into history, and the beginning of the web, and then later go deeper into ENS and NFT. So feel free to switch between the headers! Also i would be happy about a rating, comment or follow on [twitter](twitter.com/lennardeth) for more blog posts!

### How did domains get started?

Back in the older days, universities were the first "companies" that had domains. They used it for communication and storing files, because of their big influence into the science. In 1972 the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/) was created, one of the first institutions of the intetnet. The company still is the Authority of Internet Assigned Numbers. In short: They manage all "numbers" (IPs) of the whole internet. WHOA ðŸ¤¯.

After the base was created in 1983 the DNS was created. The DNS acts like a phone book for the domains. A basic DNS lookup tool can be tested [here](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx). When requesting a domain, such as google.com, the Domain-Name-Service translates it into a server IP, where the requested resource is located at. Funfact: The first name server was created by the university of Wisconsin. 

Then in 1984 the world was changed: The TLD was created. A TLD stands for Top-Level-Domain and is found in the end of each domain. Such as: google.**com**, facebook.**com** and others. The main purpose of a TLD is to classify the requetsed domain. For example [wikipedia.org](wikipedia.org) stands for a ORG- Organisation. You can find a full list of domain TLDs [here](www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains). Feel free to scroll thru some!

### How do domains work/ registrars?

After we have clarified what registrants are, I am going to explain what a registrants is. [ICANN](ICANN.org), the "Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers", allows registrars of a given domain to register a domain. For example: [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), a well known registrar

By the way: You can expect a lot of costs when trying to get a license. Only the fee for applying is 11,000$, but this wont even guarantee a license. There are a lot of other parameters such as a 500k$ insurance, that are needed. This allows maximum safety!

The whole processs wont fit into this post, but this image can give you a really good overview about the flow of registering a domain. The end user will only see the registar, for example namecheap, that handles every other step in a matter of minutes.

### What is a ENS, and how does it work?

[ENS](https://ens.domains) is a short term of Ethereum-Name-Service. There are many many other websites that allow such type of registrations, but ENS is known the most. 

It's base has two parts contracts. One smart contract handles all the registration. That is also the point where a ENS "domain" is 
**not a real domain**: They store their data in mapping, what is like a big array. The other smart contract is for resolving, for example to get the owner of the domain. You can view it's webpage here: [resolver of lennard.eth](https://app.ens.domains/name/lennard.eth/details). Please keep in mind that *i do not own lennard.eth*. When buying such a "domain" you get a NFT with the metadata (resolving data) and with it the avaibility to change the registry (transfer it, the nft owner also owns the domain!) and gain $ENS, their token.

### Why you can't handle a ENS like a domain.

Here is where the magic comes in. A domain is resolved by the ICANN Organization, a central org that is used by the **whole** net. 

But ENS is different. They are one of 100s of ethereum domain registrations and in the end just offer a NFT collection and a way to store and view the data of domains. So basically everyone can do it- [buildspace](buildspace.so) offers a great community to learn web3 coding, for example offering a project including a ENS-like service, but on Polygon. 

### Why does everyone use ENS as domain?

But why does everyone uses ENS as a domain-like service? That is pretty easy- they are the biggest. When someone shows of their domain, for example as username on twitter, most people will instantly think of ENS, go to their site, enter the name and look it up. But in the end its just a NFT, that is stored on the blockchain. It could even be a domain from a service programmed by a buildspace member. ðŸ˜Š

### Summary

To sum it all up: ENS is a great service as a NFT or a idetification, but not a domain.
Thank you for reading! I hope i had the chance to explain more about the ENS and get you a better view of it! Feel free to have a look at my [twitter](twitter.com/lennardeth) or to leave a good review!
